    " Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique that combines the L1 regularization (Lasso) and L2 regularization (Ridge) methods. It is used in machine learning and statistics for regression analysis, where the goal is to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables. Elastic Net combines the strengths of both Lasso and Ridge regression while mitigating some of their limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso (L1 regularization) encourages sparsity in the model by adding a penalty term that encourages some coefficients to become exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "Ridge (L2 regularization) adds a penalty term that discourages large coefficient values, which can help prevent overfitting.\n",
    "Elastic Net combines these two regularization techniques by introducing two hyperparameters, alpha (α) and l1_ratio (ρ), to control the balance between L1 and L2 regularization"

    " Choosing optimal values for the regularization parameters (alpha and l1_ratio) in Elastic Net Regression typically involves using techniques like cross-validation. You can train Elastic Net models with various combinations of alpha and l1_ratio values and select the combination that yields the best performance based on a chosen evaluation metric (e.g., mean squared error for regression problems). Cross-validation helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to new data."
